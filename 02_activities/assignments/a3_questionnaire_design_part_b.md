# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
Despite the strengths, there are potential limitations to consider. For example, using social media and music forums as sampling sources might introduce bias if certain demographic groups are overrepresented or underrepresented compared to the general population. Additionally, reliance on University of Toronto students could skew the sample towards a younger and potentially more educated demographic.

Sampling Frame: The sampling frame includes University of Toronto students, community organizations, social media platforms, and music-related forums. This diverse set of sources helps in reaching a broader cross-section of the target population, including individuals from various backgrounds and demographics. This approach enhances the likelihood of capturing a representative sample of adults aged 18 and above.

Target Population: The target population is clearly defined as adults aged 18 and above from diverse backgrounds. The sampling frame and strategy are aligned with this definition, suggesting efforts to encompass a wide range of perspectives and experiences related to music preferences across different age groups.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    Survey quakity: Added questions about demographic characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This information can provide context for analyzing how different demographic groups perceive and engage with music.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, an observational study would not suffice to fully achieve the survey's purpose.

- Observational studies lack direct access to individuals' personal preferences, the underlying motivations behind their music choices, or their subjective experiences.

- Surveys enable respondents to provide self-reported data, allowing for detailed insights into specific methods of music discovery that cannot be accurately captured through observation alone.

- Conducting observational studies is logistically complex and resource-intensive, posing challenges in obtaining data from a large and diverse sample.

- Sensitive information, such as the influence of personal life circumstances on music preferences, can be confidentially obtained through surveys but remains inaccessible through observational methods.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
